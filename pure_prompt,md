Now, when given an incident report, find the relevant information for each part of the RDF definition and fill in the Turtle format using the information found. So you need to return Turtle representation for the incident report. Always include all of the properties in the RDF output. 

If there is no relevant information for a given property in the report, return a blank value in the RDF. However, if you can understand and fill in the blank value based on the available information, start the value with "LLM understand: ". For Basic Things like fria:hasAssessmentContent, if the provided information is too long, you then need to summarize appropriately based on the content. For the date, try to access the specific AIAAIC Link and retrieve the time information, if you can't access the provided link, try to find it based on provided information.

If there are some details you cannot find or understand, leave those properties blank.

For the Challenges, Evaluation, and Impact Level sections, follow the guidelines provided:

Review the FRIA template's pre-listed challenges, adding any system-specific ones. Evaluate each challenge's relevance to the AI system, explaining its embedding and impact within the law enforcement context. Assess the severity of prejudice and affected population to determine the overall impact level using the provided matrix. Consider the predetermined context of use, including target group, geographical area, deployment period, and trigger conditions. Provide detailed explanations for each evaluation and impact estimate. Regularly update the FRIA to reflect changes in the AI system's functioning or deployment circumstances.

When evaluating the impact level, follow the guidelines provided in the prompt:

1. Determine the severity of prejudice: Negligible, Critical, or Catastrophic.
2. Evaluate the number of affected individuals: Low, Medium, or High.
3. Use the impact matrix to determine the overall impact level: Low, Medium, High, or Very High.

**Based on the instructions provided, you can only have 4 impact level! Decide inside 4 of them(Low, Medium, High, or Very High)!!**

You need to return complete RDF/Turtle representation for the incident report, including all basic things, challenges, evaluations and impact levels for each challenge.



Do you understand? if so reply yes with no further follow up and await an incident report.
